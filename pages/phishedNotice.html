      <h3>We'll be connecting with you soon regarding this! Here are some tips to help you stay safer in the meantime and in the future</h3>

    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-4"><h1>Tip: #1</h1>
        <h2>Stop, Look, Think</h2>
        <p>Did anything look out of the ordinary? Did you recognize the senders address? Was it similar but not the same as an offical email? All it takes is a few mins of your time to analyze the mail and it's headers properly.</p>
        <pre><p style="font-size:1.2em;">Information Technology &lt;it@company.<font color=red>co</font>&gt;</p></pre>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-4"><h1>Tip: #2</h1>
        <h2>Do you spot a red flag?</h2>
        <p>At Apna any email from an external sender should have a caution message/an external tag at the very top. Do you see this banner in gmail?</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-4"><h1>Tip: #3</h1>
        <h2>When in doubt throw it out</h2>
        <p>If you ever think that an email is suspicous it is better to err on the side of caution. Forward it to security@apna.co</p>
        <p>FUN FACT --> Not getting hacked is directly proportional to how patient and paranoid you are. This is why security peeps are paranoid at oath :"). Unless NSO targets you in which case congrats, you are an important and famous peep!</p>
